# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Pattern

# A. Introduction
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

# B. Instructions
Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. You can get download the repository with git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git. Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, so it's the best place to get the project files.
cd into the project-bikesharing directory.
Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson. These are also outlined in the repository README.

Create a new conda environment:
conda create --name deep-learning python=3

Enter your new environment:

Mac/Linux: >> source activate deep-learning

Windows: >> activate deep-learning

Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:

conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook

Run the following to open up the notebook server:
jupyter notebook
